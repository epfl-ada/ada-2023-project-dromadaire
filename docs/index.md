# The data

this parts describes the datasets that we are going to use, what they look like, what we have to be careful about etc... We also show the data transformations that are going to fir our purpose

## Datasets

this is the list of the datasets we are going to use and a little bit of information about them (for more details about things such as NA count, we could link to an other page, see example below)

### Dataset 1 
this is the first dataset, it is about this and here is where you can find it and some brief information about the pitfalls and things to be careful with. See [this page](./dataset1_details.md)

## Shaping our final datasets

here we explain the datasets we want to end up with (and why) and everything we did to get there

Finish by showing pictures of the final datasets

# Research

Here we detail the steps we are taking to reach our final goal

We probably want to add chapters to further structure this part

# Results

Here we summarize the results that we found 

# Source

list of arcticles and whatever else we needed to get to our final result

let's see if we actually keep this
